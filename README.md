**Key Features:**

1. **Effortless Request Submission:** With our user-friendly form, employees can effortlessly submit time off requests, specifying the dates and reasons for their requested time off.

This PDF is then automatically sent to the employee's email, ensuring they have a record of their request.

3. **Seamless Tracking:** The submitted time off requests are seamlessly logged into a Google Sheet connected to the form. This feature allows both employees and employers to keep track of pending and approved requests in real-time. It's a straightforward way to manage and monitor time off allocation.
